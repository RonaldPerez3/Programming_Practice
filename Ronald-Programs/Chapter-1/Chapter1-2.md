Chapter 1.2- Computer Systems: Hardware and Software

Concept:

All computer systems consist of similar hardware devices and software components. This section
provides an overview of standard computer hardware and software organization.

Overview:

Hardware:

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer. A computer, as we generally think of it,
is not an individual device but a system of devices.A typical computer system consists of the 
following major components:

- The central processing unit (CPU)
- Main memory (random access memory, or RAM)
- Secondary storage devices
- Input devices
- Output devices


CPU:

When a computer is performing the tasks that a program tells it to do, we say that the computer is
running or executing the program. The central processing unit, or CPU, is the part of a computer that
actually runs programs. The CPU is the most important component in a computer because without it the
computer could not run software.

The CPU’s job is to fetch instructions, follow the instructions, and produce some result. Internally, 
the central processing unit consistsof two parts: the control unit and the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU).
The control unit coordinates all of the computer’s operations. It is responsible for determining where to
get the next instruction and for regulating the other major components of the computer with control
signals. The arithmetic and logic unit, as its name suggests, is designed to perform mathematical
operations.

A program is a sequence of instructions stored in the computer’s memory. When a computer is running a 
program, the CPU is engaged in a process known formally as the fetch/decode/execute cycle.


Main Memory

You can think of main memory as the computer’s work area. This is where the computer stores a program 
while the program is running, as well as the data that the program is working with.

Main memory is commonly known as random access memory or RAM. It is called this because the CPU is able
to quickly access data stored at any random location in this memory. RAM is usually a volatile type of 
memory that is used only for temporary storage while a program is running. When the computer is turned
off, the contents of RAM are erased. Inside your computer, RAM is stored in small chips.

A computer’s memory is divided into tiny storage cells known as bytes. One byte is enough memory to store
just a single letter of the alphabet or a small number. In order to do anything meaningful, a computer has
to have lots of bytes. Most computers today have millions, or even billions, of bytes of memory. Each byte
is divided into eight smaller storage locations known as bits. The term bit stands for binary digit.
Computer scientists usually think of bits as tiny switches that can be either on or off. Bits aren’t
actual “switches,” however, at least not in the conventional sense. In most computer systems, bits are tiny
electrical components that can hold either a positive or a negative charge. Computer scientists think of a
positive charge as a switch in the on position and a negative charge as a switch in the off position.

Each byte is assigned a unique number known as an address. The addresses are ordered from lowest to highest.
A byte is identified by its address, in much the same way a post office box is identified by an address, so
that the data stored there can be located.
