1.1: Why Program:

Concept:

Computers can do many diferent jobs because they are programmable

Overview:

Computers can do a wide vvariety of things because they are programmed; so they can do not just 1 job,
but any job that they areprogrammed to. A program, also known as software, is a set of instuctions that
a computer follows to perform a task. A programmer, or software developer, is a person with the training
and skills necessary to design, create, and test computer programs.

Computer programming is both an art and a science. It is an art because every aspect of a program should
be designed with care and judgement. Listed below are a few thiings that must be designed for any 
real-world computer programs:

- The logical flow of the instructions
- The mathematical procedures
- The appearance of the screens
- The way information is presented to the user
- The program's "user-friendliness"
- Documentation, help files, tutorials, etc.

There is also a scientific, or engineering side to programming. Because programs rarely work right the
first time they are written, a lot of experimentation, correction, and redesigning is required. This
demands patience and persistence of the programmer. Writing software demands discipline as well. 
Programmers must learn special languages like C++ because computers do not understand English or other
human languages. Languages such as C++ have strict rules that must be carefully followed.

Both the artistic and scientific nature of programming makes writing computer software like designing a
car. Both cars and programs should be functional, efficient, powerful, easy to use, and pleasing to
look at.
